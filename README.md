# Project Notes

> Most of the ideas for the different pages has been developed over time. Most of my notes can be found within the bug-list and the time-report

# Project Summary

> This project is a webpage that has a Music Quiz built into it. The Music Quiz is my project for the Programming course. This project however is the page itself, a welcome page along with a contact page, an "about" page which some "commercial-like" features, and a session statistic page that outputs the stored values from your Music Quiz games.  
I have been sticking to the budget timewise, although, some of the time from this project went in to designing the game. When I felt that the page and the game was well designed I looked into creating some different things, like a scrolling text-bar, a dropdown menu and a fixed button with some animation etc.
